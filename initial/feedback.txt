We had what I thought was a productive discussion regarding your project.  
Might you be willing to share an excerpt of the Yelp data along with the 
codebook?  

It would be helpful if at some point you were able to put together a revised 
initial proposal before the revised proposal deadline (but this is not a requirement).
I've reopened this issue and would be glad to work back and forth with you through
the issue.
